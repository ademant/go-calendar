# dansal API

RESTful calendar API backed by SQLite. All timestamps are RFC3339.

## Base URL
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Authentication

Protected endpoints require a Bearer token obtained from `POST /api/v1/login`, or an API key created via `POST /api/v1/apikeys`.

```
Authorization: Bearer <token-or-api-key>
```

API keys begin with `ak_` and never expire. Session tokens expire after the configured duration (default 24 h).

Public GET endpoints accept an optional `Authorization` header; an invalid or expired token is still rejected with 401.

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| `admin` | Full access; bypasses all organization checks |
| `user` | Read + write; must be org member for org-linked resources |
| `publisher` | Read + create; no update or delete |
| `viewer` | Read published events only |

## Events

### Event object

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "uid": "abc123@example.com",
  "title": "Bal Folk",
  "description": "string",
  "start_time": "2026-05-15T20:00:00+02:00",
  "end_time": "2026-05-15T23:00:00+02:00",
  "has_ball": true,
  "has_workshop": false,
  "is_cancelled": false,
  "tags": ["bal-folk", "Köln"],
  "is_published": true,
  "short_code": "8b911390",
  "url": "https://example.com/event/42",
  "image_url": "/api/v1/images/1",
  "organization_id": 3,
  "location_id": 7,
  "location": "Kulturzentrum",
  "location_town": "Berlin",
  "location_country": "Germany",
  "pricing": {
    "type": "multiple",
    "currency": "EUR",
    "prices": [
      { "label": "normal", "amount": 12 },
      { "label": "student", "amount": 8 }
    ]
  },
  "musicians": [
    { "id": 2, "bandname": "La Troupe" }
  ],
  "timetable": [
    {
      "id": 1, "event_id": 1,
      "start_time": "20:00", "end_time": "21:30",
      "title": "Workshop", "description": "string", "room": "Hall A",
      "location_id": 7, "location_name": "Kulturzentrum",
      "created_at": "..."
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "..."
}
```

The `pricing` field is optional. `type` must be one of:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `free` | No admission fee |
| `donation` | Pay what you want |
| `single` | One fixed price; set `amount` and optionally `currency` |
| `multiple` | Tiered pricing; set `prices` as `[{label, amount}]` and optionally `currency` |

`uid` is set from the iCal `UID` field on import and used for deduplication: re-importing the same feed updates existing events. Without `uid`, deduplication falls back to title + location + start time (±3 h).

`timetable` and `musicians` are only populated on `GET /api/v1/events/{id}`, not in the list endpoint.

### Endpoints

GET endpoints are public (optional auth). Write endpoints require authentication.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/events` | List events |
| POST | `/api/v1/events` | Create event(s) |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/events` | Bulk-update events |
| GET | `/api/v1/events/{id}` | Get event (includes timetable + musicians) |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/events/{id}` | Delete event |
| POST | `/api/v1/events/{id}/publish` | Publish event |
| POST | `/api/v1/events/{id}/timetable` | Add timetable entries |
| PUT | `/api/v1/events/{id}/timetable` | Replace timetable |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/events/{id}/timetable/{entry_id}` | Delete timetable entry |
| POST | `/api/v1/events/{id}/locations` | Attach location |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/events/{id}/locations/{location_id}` | Detach location |

**Write access:** `user`/`publisher` must be members of the event's `organization_id`. `admin` bypasses this check.

**Publication:** events created by `user` or `admin` are published immediately; `publisher` and `viewer` create unpublished events.

```json

### Timetable entries

**Add (POST) / Replace (PUT) body** — array of:
```json

    "title": "Workshop", "description": "string",
    "room": "Hall A", "location_id": 7
  }
]
```

`start_time` and `end_time` are `HH:MM` clock times relative to the event date.

---

## Images

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/images/{event_id}` | Get event image (AVIF) — public |
| POST | `/api/v1/images/{event_id}` | Upload event image |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/images/{event_id}` | Delete event image |

Upload accepts any common image format. The image is resized to configured dimensions and stored as AVIF.

---

## Tags

### GET /api/v1/tags — public

Returns all distinct tags across published events.

```json
["Bal Folk", "Workshop", "Köln"]
```

---

## iCal feeds — public

No authentication required.

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v1/events.ics` | All published events |
| `GET /api/v1/events/tag/{tag}.ics` | Published events for a specific tag |
| `GET /api/v1/events/town/{town}.ics` | Published events for a specific town |

Supports `Accept: text/calendar` on `GET /api/v1/events` as an alternative to the `.ics` paths.

---

## Fetch Sources

Stores external calendar feeds and imports events from them on demand. All endpoints require at least `user` role.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/fetchurl` | List sources |
| POST | `/api/v1/fetchurl` | Add single source and import |
| POST | `/api/v1/fetchurl/bulk` | Add multiple sources and import |
| GET | `/api/v1/fetchurl/{id}` | Get source |
| POST | `/api/v1/fetchurl/{id}/fetch` | Re-import from source |
| POST | `/api/v1/fetchurl/fetch-all` | Re-import from all sources |

**Fetch source object:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "url": "https://example.com/calendar.ics",
  "type": "ical",
  "tags": ["bal-folk"],
  "organization_id": 3,
  "last_fetched_at": "2026-05-15T10:00:00Z",
  "created_at": "..."
}
```

`organization_id` — when set, all events imported from this source are assigned to that organization, overriding any organizer information in the feed itself.

**Supported types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ical` | Standard iCalendar feed |
| `folkdance-json` | folkdance.page JSON API |

Type is auto-detected via a HEAD request when omitted.

### POST /api/v1/fetchurl

```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/calendar.ics", "type": "ical", "tags": ["bal-folk"], "organization": "My Dance Club" }
```

`type` and `tags` are optional. `organization` (string name) finds or creates an organization with that name and assigns it to the source. `organization_id` (integer) takes precedence when both are provided.

Re-POSTing the same URL updates its `type`, `tags`, and `organization_id` (upsert by URL).

Response: array of imported event objects. `201` when all events were newly created; `200` if any were updates.

### POST /api/v1/fetchurl/bulk

Registers and imports multiple sources in one call. Entries that do not contain `://` are treated as tags applied to every source in the batch.

```json
{
  "entries": [
    "https://example.com/feed1.ics",
    "https://example.com/feed2.ics",
    "bal-folk"
  ],
  "tags": ["Germany"],
  "organization": "My Dance Club"
}
```

`type` — optional; auto-detected per URL when omitted. `organization`, `organization_id`, and `tags` are applied to all sources. `organization_id` takes precedence over `organization` when both are set.

Response: array of per-source results:
```json
[
  { "url": "https://…/feed1.ics", "source_id": 1, "events": 12, "all_created": true },
  { "url": "https://…/feed2.ics", "source_id": 2, "events": 3,  "all_created": false },
  { "url": "https://…/feed3.ics", "source_id": 3, "events": 0,  "error": "remote returned 404" }
]
```

### POST /api/v1/fetchurl/fetch-all

Re-imports all stored sources in parallel. Same response shape as `/bulk`.
